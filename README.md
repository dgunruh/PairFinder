# The Best Pairs Finder Project

Welcome to the project template. Feel free to use and modify this template in any way you want to!

## How to start the project

First you should install the required python packages contained in the file ```requirements.txt```

Then you can start by taking a look at some tests examples given in ```test/integration_test/test_best_pairs_finder.py```

These integrations tests are skipped for now. A simple way to start working with Test Driven Development routine could be to unskip the simplest one and try to come up with a simple solution.

Remember that this template is just a starting point, you have to create your own tests, documentation and algorithms!

We also provide an example of a particle generator in ```test/particle_generator.py``` This function might be useful if you want to test your method on general cases.

## CICD

The file ```.gitlab-ci.yml``` contains information for gitlab about how to execute the tests and how to publish the documentation.
You will find the documentation site following this link: https://the-munchkins.gitlab.io/project-template


## Mkdocs

The html documentation of this project is created using a tool named [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org). You can access and modify its configuration file: ```mkdocs.yml```
The html documentation is generated by MkDocs starting from markdown files contained in the source code i.e. in the ```src``` folder. One basic example is given by the file ```src/index.md```
